There is no denying in the fact the Coronavirus is the one of the biggest crisis this world has ever faced. All countries are facing one gigantic problem at the same time.

Now without a doubt all of us getting impacted by coronavirus in some way or form. People are losing jobs, travel and hospitability industry is badly hit, school and college classes have gone online and of cpourse you can't go to any public places.

Despite all this, many people who are locked at home can benefit a lot from this lockdown time. And I am not taking about introverts. I am talking about people who always a time deficit to do things.


Here are few things you can do to make most out of this lockdown:

### 1. Workout ###

"I don’t have time to work out". "Oh man I am too busy to work out". That’s the common excuse people have against working out. And sometimes it a genuine reason too.

There are days on which you really don’t get time to hit the gym. But now with 24 hours of the day being at home there is more than enough time to work out.

Buy some weights and there are unlimited workout you can do at home. [Why You Should invest in Home Gym ?](https://www.amankaushik.blog/benfits-of-home-gym/)

This time is very stressful for everyone and meditation is very effective and cheapest way to keep the stress at bay. There are tremendous benefits of meditation on your mind and body.

Meditation is another gift by The East to the world and it’s definitely worth trying to improve your overall well being.


### 3. Self-Care ### 

In the hustle bustle of life, it’s very hard to find out time for self-care. There are many self-care activities that you might wanted to do daily, but were unable to do because of lack of time.

Taking care of your skin. Doing detox diet for day. Maintaining a journal. Getting enough sleep. Spending enough time with your loved ones. Following a nutritious, healthy diet, etc. You can do all of these or atleast some of these activities now.

Do at least one relaxing activity every day, whether it’s taking a walk or spending 30 minutes unwinding with something you love. Even taking a proper shower without being in hurry can improve your mood. 


### 4. Online Courses ###

There is no better way to learn something new other than doing online course.
