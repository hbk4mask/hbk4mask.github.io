We all hear and read often that why it's so important to drink adequate amount of water. Some of us might have read that we need water for all body function. It flushes toxins from the organs, takes nutrients to your cells, cushions the joints, and helps us digest the food we eat. But even after knowing how its necessary to drink water, almost 90% of us failed drink enough water. And not only miss the recomme water intake marke, we miss the recommended water intake by a big margin.  

*So what is the problem? Why can't we drink enough water?*
