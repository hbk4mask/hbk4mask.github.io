We all hear and read often that why it's so important to drink adequate amount of water.
Some of us might have read that we need water for all body function. It flushes toxins 
from the organs, takes nutrients to your cells, cushions the joints, and helps us digest
the food we eat.  

But even after knowing how its necessary to drink water, almost 90% of
us failed drink enough water. And not only miss the recomme water intake marke, we miss
the recommended water intake by a big margin.  

**_So what is the problem? Why can't we drink enough water?_**

Well there is not a single answer.

The main reason is we we don't drink enough water is that we don't feel like drinking recommended amount of water. We only drink water when we feel thirsty. It's like asking why don't we go to washroom 20 times in day. The answer is simple we dont go to washroom 20 times in day because we don't urge to use washroom that many times.
