We all hear and read often that why it's so important to drink adequate amount of water.
Some of us might have read that we need water for all body function. It flushes toxins 
from the organs, takes nutrients to your cells, cushions the joints, and helps us digest
the food we eat.  

But even after knowing why it's necessary to drink enough water almost 90% of
us failed drink the recommnened amount of water. And not only we miss the recommended amoount of water intake, we miss
it by a big margin.  

**_So what is the problem? Why can't we drink enough water? Nobody says we don't eat enough food_**

Well there is not a single answer.

The main reason is that we don't drink enough water is that **we don't get the urge drinking recommended amount of water**. We only drink water when we feel thirsty. 

It's like asking why don't we go to washroom 20 times in day. The answer is again similar. We don't go to washroom 20 times in day because we don't get the urge to use washroom that many times. But doctors don't give us sugestion to use washroom 20 times in day. At least I am not aware of it. So how come we drinking enough water is different?

>Why we have to force ourself to drink more water than we feel like drinking it?  


The answer is **because we feel thirsty only when our brain realises we are water deficient**. We crave for water only when your brain gets the stats that you are running low on water. Interesting point is when we start drinking water our brain tells us when stop guzzling down water. Altough the water takes time get absorbed from stomach to blood stream, still brain knows how much water to drink.  

Unlike water, this concept of stopping water intake is not applicable to food. Our brain tells us to stop eating bit late. Late enough that we always tend to overeat. Lucky us.

>So when we feel thirsty or craving to drink beverage, it is already too late. You are already water deficient.

The brain take matters in its own hands and ask you stop whatever you are doing that time and look for some beverage.
Now this signal by brain to drink water is not always clear enough to state that we need water. Sometimes we feel craving for food instead of fluids.

It can be craving for a fruit, desering an ice cream, or craving for a smoothie. All of these food items again contains mostly fluids but not they are not the best source to quinch your thirst.
