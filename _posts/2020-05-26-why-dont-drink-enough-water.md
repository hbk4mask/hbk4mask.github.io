We all hear and read often that it’s very important to drink an adequate amount of water for proper functioning of body. Water is essential to body. It flushes toxins from the organs, takes nutrients to the cells, cushions the joints, and helps us digest the food we eat.  
  

But even after knowing why it’s necessary to drink enough water, almost 90% of us fail to drink the recommended amount of water. And not only we miss the recommended amount of water intake, we miss it by a significant margin.
 

**_So what is the problem? Why can't we drink enough water? Nobody says we don't eat enough food._**

Well there is an answer.

The main reason is that we don't drink enough water is that **we don’t get the urge to drink the recommended amount of water. We only drink water when we feel thirsty**. We only drink water when we feel thirsty. 

Let's discuss another question of similar nature. Why don’t we go to the washroom 20 times a day. The answer is again similar. We don’t go to the washroom 20 times a day because we don’t get the urge to use the washroom that many times. But doctors don’t give us suggestions to use the washroom 20 times in a day. At least I am not aware of it. So how come drinking water is different?


>Why we have to force ourself to drink more water than we feel like drinking it?  


The answer is **we feel thirsty only when our brain realizes we are water deficient**. We crave for water only when your brain gets the stats that you are running low on water. So when you are dehydrated, you may gulp down water for several seconds, and you feel satisfied. 

An interesting point is when we start drinking water upon realizing that we are thirsty, our brain tells us when we stop guzzling down water.

> Although the water takes time to get absorbed from stomach to the bloodstream (it usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes), still brain somehow knows how much water you need.
  

Unlike water, this concept of stopping water intake is not applicable to food intake. Our brain tells us to stop eating a bit late as the brain registers food late as the stomach takes about 20 minutes to acknowledge the food. 	Late enough for us to overeat. Lucky us.

>So when we feel thirsty or craving to drink beverage, it is already too late. You are already water deficient.

The brain takes matters in its own hands and asks you to stop whatever you are doing that time and look for some beverage. Now this signal in which the brain asks you to drink water is not always clear enough to state that we need water. **Sometimes even though we are water deficient, we feel the craving to eat food instead of drinking water**.

It can be a craving for fruit, desiring ice cream, or craving for a smoothie. All of these food items again contain mostly fluids. And drinking some non-water beverages can leave you feeling instantly hydrated, as well. But they are not the best source to quench your thirst. 

So we are fooled by our desire to eat food when we should be drinking water. Hence it is good to drink water before you eat, so that you can separate the hunger from the thirst.

encouraging animals to drink more water before sleeping to avoid becoming dehydrated during long periods of sleep.

It is clear that we need to keep ourself hydrated through out the day without being reminded by our brain to do so. One trick can helo you tremendously to reach the recommended amount of water intake. Proximity to water.

>Promixity to water source can effect your water intake

Wait a minute ! Promixity to water ? We have water in our houses, in our workplaces, schools. We are always close to water source. But not close enough. How many times
