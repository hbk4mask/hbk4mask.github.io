We all hear and read often that why it's so important to drink adequate amount of water.
Some of us might have read that we need water for all body function. It flushes toxins 
from the organs, takes nutrients to your cells, cushions the joints, and helps us digest
the food we eat.  

But even after knowing how its necessary to drink water, almost 90% of
us failed drink enough water. And not only miss the recomme water intake marke, we miss
the recommended water intake by a big margin.  

**_So what is the problem? Why can't we drink enough water?_**

Well there is not a single answer.

The main reason is that we don't drink enough water is that **we don't get the urge drinking recommended amount of water**. We only drink water when we feel thirsty. 

It's like asking why don't we go to washroom 20 times in day. The answer is again similar. We dont go to washroom 20 times in day because we don't get the urge to use washroom that many times. But doctors don't give us sugestion to use washroom 20 times in day. At least I am not aware of it. So how come we drinking enough water is different?

>Why we have to force ourself to drink more water than we feel like drinking it?  


The answer is **because we feel thirsy only when our brain realises we are water deficient**. We crave for water only when your brain gets the stats that you are running low on water. Interesting point is when we start drinking water our brain tells us when stop guzzling down water. Altough the water takes time get absorbed from stomach to blood stream, still brain knows how much water to drink.  

Unlike water, this concept of stopping water intake is not applicable to food. Our brain tells us to stop eating bit late. Late enough that we overeat. Lucky us.
