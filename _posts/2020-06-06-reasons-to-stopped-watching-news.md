Every time you open news channel, you see world is dealing with a new disaster, a war happening somewhere killing innocent people, crime rates spiking, pollution level at all time high, terrorism spreading, poverty not ending, oppression, crisis etc.

Now there is nothing wrong in covering news, but giving every news the label of a heart wrenching tragedy we should be paying attention to is just blatantly wrong. Before we go further and discuss why you should stop watching news channels, let’s remind ourselves what is the meaning of news.

As per Merriam Webster dictionary, Definition of news: 

<em>a: report of recent events </em><br>
<em>b: previously unknown information </em><br>
<em>c: something having a specified influence or effect</em><br>


News channels focus on the third definition above everything else. 


### News channels makes you stressed out and anxious ###

The way news channels portray the negative news is something worth paying attention to. <em>**News media love negative news and they love exaggerating the negative news to the epic proportions to garner more viewers**</em>. But this distortion has consequences.

If you have fitness watch you can confirm it yourself. Watch your heart rate rises after few minutes of watching your favorite news channel.

A recent survey from the American Psychological Association found More than half of Americans say the news causes them stress, and many report feeling anxiety, fatigue or sleep loss as a result.

>Whether or not the world really is getting worse, the way news channels shows it, watching it will make us think that it is. The nature of news likely distorts people’s view of the world


### News Watching is Emotionally Draining ###

News channels want to play news which effect viewers emotionally. The emotion can be vary from inciting patriotism or hatred towards people responsible for an incident, sympathy for a cause. News media will try to get news which will invoke some emotion which can keep you glued to the channel. 

Watching the news which evokes your emotions makes you mentally drained. You will feel be feeling anxious inside without even realizing it.  If you are already being robbed of your peace of mind silenty, then even a little bit of uncomfortable time will make you loose your mind.

Now why do you watch news channel? To know what’s happening around. And when you switch to a News channel you see three grown up men yelling at each other, over speaking on each other. And even if you get an idea of what are fighting about you can’t continue watching it. Insulting the guest news channel invites and pay is normal. 

 >**Inciting public sentiment over sensitive issues, over and over again is the recipe most news channels never get bored of.** 

So do news channels are aware of this? Don’t they know they can do better than this? Of course they do. But doing won’t keep the people glued to the channel.



### News channels are biased ###

As news journalist what should be your job? To tell the news and to be unbiased while doing so.
But in current times news channels are rarely unbiased. Either they are pro subject or anti subject. Either they are pro government or anti-government. 

Most news channels pick a side, and they do so in order to garner viewership from people who are on same side. When you are of certain opinion on some political topic and you see news anchor is also echoing your emotions you come aboard and feel validation in your opinion and thinking. You as viewers can feel connected to the channel. 

People of all political orientation has found their favorite news channel. Right wing people found pro right wing news channel, left wing people watch left-wing news channel. Pro government people watch pro-government channel and anti-government people watch anti-government news channels.And by doing this the truth never reaches you.



### News Belittle Your Own Ambitions ###

Well if you want to work on your goals, watching news channels is something you should avoid. Repeated hype mongering happening on news channels messes up your ability to focus on things around you. News channels want you to care about news, they want you to think about it. 

They want to you worry about the issues in the world and not just to be aware about it, so you will be tempted watching more news, and that is not good for you. As Naval Ravikant said:

> **“Stay away from people who are world-weary and belittle your ambitions.”**

Being aware of current situation of Israel Philistine conflict is good, but you don’t have to think watching news about it will change anything. It takes your attention away from things that need more thinking.

Husband watching news channel and telling wife “you are talking about one plant drying in lawn? Here people are dying all over the world. 


 
### Repetitions of content ### 

There is always something new happening in the world we live in. And we don't have to know about all of it. For instance, if there is a robbery happened in luxurious closed gated community. It can be a news for people in its locailty but not for you living 1000 miles away from it.

If a cat got lost and returns home after a month its not a news. Other thing is when there is nothing else to show news channels will pick the same news and show it with a new guest, in the name of "a different perspective".

Truth is there is not always a worthy content to show and in these times news channels picks the same old content and their favorite recipe of targeting the emotions. 


>**News media has forgotton the unspoken rules of news coverage and people have no other option other than to be served with this low quality news/garbage.**
